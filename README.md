# Just-Another-Platformer

## :zap: About
This is an attempt of mine at replicating some slightly advanced mechanics in a platformer game in the Godot game engine! I hope you like it!

## :desktop_computer: How to run locally
I have not yet exported the project. So you'll need to run it using the Godot engine itself. Just clone the repository and import `project.godot` into the engine!

## :grey_question: Controls
- Move around with the left, right and up arrow keys. (Or `W`, `A`, `S` and `D`)
- Select items in the menus with up and down arrow keys.
- Accept selected items with `enter` or `space`.
- Press any key to restart when the game is over!
